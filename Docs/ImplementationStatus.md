## Conclusion
The RaiseYourVoice platform has made significant progress with the backend implementation. The MongoDB integration is complete with specialized repository implementations for all entities, along with a comprehensive indexing strategy for optimal query performance. Recently, the server-side translation system has been implemented, providing language header support for both English and Albanian languages with efficient Redis caching. This enables the backend to return pre-translated content based on the client's language preference. The JWT authentication system with refresh token rotation provides a secure authentication mechanism. The next phase of implementation should focus on implementing field-level encryption for sensitive data and encrypted API paths for enhanced security.
