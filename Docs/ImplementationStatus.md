## Conclusion
The RaiseYourVoice platform has made significant progress with the backend implementation. The MongoDB integration is complete with specialized repository implementations for all entities, along with a comprehensive indexing strategy for optimal query performance. The server-side translation system has been implemented, providing language header support for both English and Albanian languages with efficient Redis caching. This enables the backend to return pre-translated content based on the client's language preference. 

Recent security enhancements include field-level encryption for sensitive data using AES-256 encryption and API path encryption for enhanced API security. The field-level encryption automatically encrypts and decrypts sensitive fields marked with the [Encrypted] attribute, ensuring that PII and payment information are securely stored in the database. The API path encryption middleware obfuscates API endpoints, making it more difficult for potential attackers to discover and target specific endpoints.

A comprehensive key rotation system has been implemented to enhance security further. This system manages encryption keys with versioning, allowing for automatic and scheduled rotation of encryption keys without disrupting the application. The system stores encryption keys in MongoDB with proper indexing for efficient lookup, and includes a background service that periodically checks for key rotation needs based on configurable settings. This ensures that even if a key is compromised, its usefulness to attackers is limited in time.

The security implementation has been further strengthened with the addition of a dedicated encryption logging service that tracks all encryption operations, key rotations, and security events. This provides comprehensive visibility into the encryption system's operation, helping to detect potential issues or security breaches early. The logging service includes performance tracking for encryption operations, detailed security event logging, and comprehensive key lifecycle event tracking.

The next phase should focus on creating automated tests for the security features, completing the gRPC services for mobile app communication, finalizing the web application features, and setting up a complete deployment pipeline.
