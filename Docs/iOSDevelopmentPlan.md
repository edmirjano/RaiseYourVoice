- **UI Framework**: UIKit with SwiftUI components where appropriate
- **Media Formats**: WebP for images, WebM for videos (preferred formats for performance and compatibility)
- **Key Libraries & Frameworks**:
  - Combine for reactive programming
  - Swift Concurrency (async/await) for asynchronous operations
  - Keychain for secure storage
  - URLSession for networking
  - CoreData for local persistence
  - Firebase for analytics and notifications
  - CoreLocation for location services
  - MapKit for map integration
  - SDWebImage with WebP support for image loading
  - GRPCSwift for gRPC communication with backend
  - KingfisherWebP for WebP image support
